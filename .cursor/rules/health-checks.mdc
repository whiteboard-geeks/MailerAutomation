Use these commands to verify that your services are running correctly before running tests.

## Flask Application Health Check

```bash
# Verify Flask app is responding:
curl http://localhost:8080/debug/env
```

**Expected**: The endpoint should return environment information without errors.

## Redis Health Check

```bash
# Verify Redis is running:
redis-cli ping
```

**Expected**: Should return `PONG` if Redis is running properly.

## Troubleshooting

If health checks fail:
- Ensure services are started in the correct order
- Check that no other services are using the required ports
- Verify environment variables are properly set
