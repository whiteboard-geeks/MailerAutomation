**BEFORE RUNNING ANY INTEGRATION TESTS**, ensure the required services are running in separate terminals.

## Service Categories

### Always Required
- Redis Server
- Flask Application

### Optional (Only if needed)
- Celery Worker - for async tasks and specific tests
- ngrok - for webhook delivery from external services

## Quick Reference
Most integration tests only need Redis + Flask. Celery and ngrok are only required for specific async/webhook scenarios.
