## Problem Summary

The `/instantly/add_lead` endpoint is failing due to Heroku's 30-second timeout
when processing large batches of leads. We need to implement async processing
with proper rate limiting and verification.

### Key Facts

- Heroku times out after 30 seconds (non-negotiable)
- Instantly API limit: **600 requests/minute** (10 requests/second)
- Current CI/CD: lint ‚Üí unit tests ‚Üí deploy staging ‚Üí integration tests ‚Üí
  deploy production

## Incremental Test-First Approach

### Step 1: Create Timeout Test (First)

**Goal:** Replicate the timeout error before fixing anything

#### 1.1 Create Failing Test

- [x] Create test file:
  `tests/integration/instantly/test_timeout_reproduction.py`
- [x] Generate test leads with required fields:
  - `email`: `lance+{timestamp}+{i}@whiteboardgeeks.com`
  - `first_name`: `TestLead`
  - `last_name`: `{i}`
  - `company_name`: `Test Company {i}` (optional)
  - `date_location`: `Test Location {timestamp}` (optional)
- [x] Mock payload structure based on existing Close webhook format
- [x] Use existing test campaign or create one: `TimeoutTest{timestamp}`
- [x] Task text format: `Instantly: TimeoutTest{timestamp}`
- [x] Set HTTP request timeout to 30 seconds on `/add_lead` call
- [x] Test should fail with `requests.exceptions.Timeout` error
- [x] **IMPROVED**: Test now sends multiple webhook calls rapidly
  (simulating real Close behavior)

#### 1.2 Two-Stage Testing Strategy

##### Stage 1: Quick Validation (20 leads)

- [x] **CONCURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**:
  - [x] Add `concurrent.futures` import for ThreadPoolExecutor
  - [x] Create `send_webhook_request()` helper method for individual requests
  - [x] Replace sequential loop with ThreadPoolExecutor (max_workers=50)
  - [x] Send all webhook requests simultaneously to trigger faster timeouts
  - [x] Process results as they complete using `as_completed()`
- [x] **FAIL-FAST IMPLEMENTATION**:
  - [x] When first timeout detected in `as_completed()` loop, cancel all
    remaining futures
  - [x] Use `future.cancel()` on all futures in `future_to_lead` dictionary
  - [x] Raise AssertionError immediately with timeout details
  - [x] Automatic cleanup still occurs via `teardown_method()`
  - [x] Provides much faster test iterations during development
- [x] Test with 20 leads first for rapid iteration and feedback
- [x] Verify timeout behavior occurs quickly (~30-60 seconds)
- [x] Get baseline metrics for processing time per lead

### Step 2: Implement Redis-Based Rate Limiter (Fix #1)

**Goal:** Add centralized rate limiting using Redis for concurrent request coordination

#### 2.1 Create Rate Limiter Test

- [x] Create test file: `tests/integration/instantly/test_redis_rate_limiter.py`
- [x] Test Redis connection and basic operations
- [x] Test leaky bucket rate limiting algorithm
- [x] Test concurrent access scenarios:
  - [x] Multiple threads trying to acquire tokens simultaneously
  - [x] Verify only allowed number of requests proceed
  - [x] Test window expiration and token refresh
- [x] Test should initially FAIL (no rate limiter implemented)

#### 2.2 Implement Redis Rate Limiter

- [x] Create `utils/rate_limiter.py` with `RedisRateLimiter` class
- [x] Implement leaky bucket algorithm using Redis
- [x] Handle Redis connection failures with fallback
- [x] Add configuration for different API limits (Instantly: 600/minute)
- [x] Test should now PASS

#### 2.3 Integration Test

- [x] Modify timeout test to verify rate limiting works
- [x] Test with 700 leads: should see controlled request rate (‚â§10/second)
- [x] HTTP request should still timeout (proving we need more fixes)

### Step 3: Implement Request Queue System (Fix #2) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Add request queuing to handle bursts without overwhelming APIs

#### 3.1 Create Queue Test ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create test file: `tests/integration/instantly/test_request_queue.py`
- [x] Test queue creation and basic operations
- [x] Test worker pool functionality
- [x] Test queue processing under load:
  - [x] Queue 100 requests simultaneously
  - [x] Verify they're processed in controlled manner
  - [x] Measure processing rate and verify it respects limits (6.64 req/s avg)
- [x] Test should initially FAIL (no queue system implemented)

#### 3.2 Implement Request Queue ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create `utils/async_queue.py` with `InstantlyRequestQueue` class
- [x] Implement async worker pool (5 concurrent workers)
- [x] Integrate with Redis rate limiter from Step 2
- [x] Add request queuing with Future-based responses
- [x] Test should now PASS

#### 3.3 Integration Test ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Test with 100 leads: all queued and processed without timeouts
- [x] Verify processing rate stays within limits (‚â§8 req/s safety margin)
- [x] Measure total processing time (15.1s for 100 requests)

### Step 4: Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern (Fix #3)

**Goal:** Add resilience against API failures and rate limit responses

#### 4.1 Create Circuit Breaker Test ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create test file: `tests/integration/instantly/test_circuit_breaker.py`
- [x] Test circuit states: CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
- [x] Test failure threshold triggering
- [x] Test automatic recovery after timeout
- [x] Mock API failures (429, 500, timeout errors)
- [x] Test initially designed to FAIL (proved need for circuit breaker)

#### 4.2 Implement Circuit Breaker ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create `utils/circuit_breaker.py` with `CircuitBreaker` class
- [x] Implement state machine (CLOSED ‚Üí OPEN ‚Üí HALF_OPEN ‚Üí CLOSED)
- [x] Add exponential backoff for failed requests
- [x] Redis-backed state persistence for cross-restart durability
- [x] Comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring
- [x] Support for independent multiple circuit breaker instances
- [x] All tests now PASS (10/10)

#### 4.3 Integration Test ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Test resilience under simulated API failures
- [x] Verify circuit opens after threshold failures
- [x] Verify automatic recovery after timeout
- [x] Updated test comments to remove "expected to fail" language
- [x] Ready for integration with queue system from Step 3

### Step 5: Implement Full Async Processing (Fix #4)

**Goal:** Return success immediately, process in background using Celery

#### 5.1 Create Async Processing Test ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create test file: `tests/integration/instantly/test_async_processing.py`
- [x] Test immediate response (no HTTP timeout) - **FAILED AS EXPECTED** ‚úÖ
  - **Result**: Request 1: 4.33s, Request 2: Timeout after 5.00s
  - **Conclusion**: Endpoint is still processing synchronously (as expected)
  - **Note**: Current endpoint returns Close `task_id`, not Celery async task ID
- [ ] Test Celery task queuing and execution
- [ ] Test integration of all previous components:
  - [ ] Rate limiter + Queue + Circuit breaker + Async
- [x] Test should initially FAIL (endpoint still synchronous) ‚úÖ

#### 5.2 Implement Async Endpoint

- [ ] Modify `/instantly/add_lead` to queue Celery task immediately
- [ ] Create `process_lead_batch_task()` Celery task
- [ ] Integrate all rate limiting components in background task
- [ ] Return task_id immediately (before 30 second timeout)
- [ ] Test should now PASS (no timeout) but leads still get processed

#### 5.3 Integration Test

- [ ] Test async processing with 500 leads
- [ ] Update test to verify immediate success response (no HTTP timeout)
- [ ] Add polling to check task completion
- [ ] Verify leads eventually appear in Instantly

### Step 6: Add Progress Tracking (Enhancement #1)

**Goal:** Monitor large batch processing progress

#### 6.1 Progress Tracking System

- [ ] Add Redis tracking for batch progress
- [ ] Create endpoint: `/instantly/task/{task_id}/status`
- [ ] Track: total leads, processed, success, errors, rate_limit_delays
- [ ] Update test to use progress tracking

### Step 7: Add Verification System (Enhancement #2)

**Goal:** Confirm leads actually exist in Instantly

#### 7.1 Lead Verification

- [ ] Research Instantly API endpoints for listing leads
- [ ] Implement lead verification function
- [ ] Add cleanup mechanism (remove test leads)
- [ ] Test verifies all leads present before cleanup

### Step 8: Scale Testing (Validation)

**Goal:** Test with realistic load

#### 8.1 Scaled Load Tests

- [ ] **Foundation**: Test with 20 leads (quick validation)
- [ ] **Baseline**: Test with 200 leads (comprehensive validation)
- [ ] **Scale Up**: Test with 500 leads (CI safe)
- [ ] **Production Scale**: Test with 1,000 leads (staging only)
- [ ] **Stress Test**: Test with 2,000 leads (manual/staging)
- [ ] Measure processing time and success rates at each stage

### Step 9: CI/CD Integration

- [ ] Add tests to existing integration test matrix
- [ ] Run Foundation tests (20 leads) on staging environment first
- [ ] Run Baseline tests (200 leads) for comprehensive validation
- [ ] Expect initial tests to FAIL (proving we can reproduce the issue)
- [ ] Document timeout behavior and processing time metrics

## Current CI/CD Integration Plan

### Existing Pipeline

```yaml
lint ‚Üí unit-tests ‚Üí deploy-staging ‚Üí integration-tests ‚Üí deploy-production
```

### Integration Points

- Integration tests run on staging environment
- Tests access staging Redis and Instantly API
- Matrix testing: `[instantly, easypost, gmail]`

### New Test Additions

- Add timeout test to `instantly` integration tests
- Expect initial test to FAIL (proving reproduction)
- Each step should make test pass further
- Final step should have complete verification

## Rate Limiting Calculations

### Instantly Limits

600 requests/minute = 10 requests/second

### Safe Rate

8 requests/second (20% buffer) = 0.125 second delay

### Conservative Rate

5 requests/second = 0.2 second delay

### Timeout Math

- 30 seconds √∑ 0.2 seconds = 150 leads max before timeout
- Need async processing for >150 leads

## Success Metrics

### Step 1 Stage 1

Test fails with timeout at 20 leads (quick reproduction)

### Step 1 Stage 2

Test fails with timeout at 200 leads (comprehensive reproduction)

### Step 2

Test fails with timeout but requests/sec ‚â§ 8 (both stages)

### Step 3

Test passes, returns immediately, processes async (both stages)

### Step 4

Progress tracking shows completion status

### Step 5

Verification confirms 100% of leads in Instantly

### Step 6

Handles progression: 20 ‚Üí 200 ‚Üí 500 ‚Üí 1000+ leads with 95%+ success

## Notes from Discussion

- Heroku times out after 30 seconds - this is non-negotiable
- Must return success quickly, then process async
- Verification is critical - can't trust that async processing completed
- Consider using `lance+datetime+i@whiteboardgeeks.com` format for test emails
- Need Instantly "remove lead" API endpoint for test cleanup
- Current code already has some rate limiting (0.5s delay in campaign fetching)

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan with team
2. Get Instantly API documentation for remove/list endpoints
3. Set up test environment with Redis and Celery

## Rate Limiting Architecture Overview

### Component Integration

```text
Request ‚Üí Redis Rate Limiter ‚Üí Request Queue ‚Üí Circuit Breaker ‚Üí Instantly API
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì                ‚Üì              ‚Üì
 Immediate      Coordinate      Handle Bursts   Handle Failures
 Response       Across          Without         Gracefully
               Instances       Timeouts
```

### Test Progression Strategy

Each step builds on the previous:

1. **Step 2**: Rate limiter works, but still times out (proves rate limiting)
2. **Step 3**: Queue + Rate limiter, controlled processing, still times out
3. **Step 4**: + Circuit breaker, resilient to failures, still times out  
4. **Step 5**: + Async processing, NO timeout, background processing
5. **Step 6+**: Enhancements and validation
